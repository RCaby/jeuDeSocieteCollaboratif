# Collaborative board game

## The project
The aim of this project is to develop a **one player** version of the board game "Gal√®rapagos", normally intended for 3 to 12 players.
The rules of the board game can be found here : [Rules](https://www.gigamic.com/files/catalog/products/rules/gigamic_galerapagos_rules_fr_04-2017-web.pdf)

This project is an opportunity to experience the developement of a complete Java/ Java Swing application, starting from a physical version of the game, to an executable. The project allows to experience the use of Github, and to learn to use tests (with JUnit 5).

Different steps are envisaged, based on the progress of the project : 
- [x] modelling of the game and its elements (class diagram, UML).
- [x] realisation of a console version of the game, without any user interaction (the game plays by itself with random behaviours)
- [x] interactive console version with randomly acting computer players
- [ ] design of a HMI with Swing
- [ ] better behaviours for the computer players (no more random behaviours)
- [ ] integration of the "Tribus et personnages" expansion which adds new features


## How to use
